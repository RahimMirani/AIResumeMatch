### Issues Identified
1. Cost Efficiency
   - High API costs for basic operations
   - Need for optimization in API usage
   - $1 cost for just two test requests

### Next Steps
1. Implement cost optimization strategies:
   - Local PDF processing before LLM
   - Caching system for processed resumes
   - Consider cheaper model alternatives
   - Implement batch processing
   - Optimize prompts for token efficiency
   - Use local processing where possible

### Notes
- LangChain integration successful but needs optimization
- Current implementation works but is cost-prohibitive
- Need to balance functionality with API costs
