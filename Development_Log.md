# Resume Comparison Tool - Development Log

## February 2, 2025 - Initial Setup and PDF Parser Implementation

### Added Components
1. Basic Flask Application Setup
   - Created main application structure
   - Implemented PDF upload endpoint `/upload-resume`
   - Added file validation and security measures
   - Set up temporary file handling with cleanup

2. PDF Parser Implementation
   - Integrated pdfminer.six for PDF text extraction
   - Added basic text cleaning functionality
   - Implemented error handling for various PDF parsing scenarios

3. Testing Infrastructure
   - Created test_upload.py for endpoint testing
   - Added curl and Postman testing instructions

## February 13, 2025 - LLM Integration and Environment Setup

### Major Changes
1. Integrated DeepSeek LLM for better resume parsing
   - Created resume_processor.py with DeepSeek API integration
   - Implemented structured JSON format for parsed resumes
   - Added HTML formatting for better display

2. Environment and Configuration Setup
   - Added .env file for secure API key storage
   - Created config.py for centralized configuration
   - Updated .gitignore to exclude sensitive files

3. Dependencies
   - Added new requirements:
     - deepseek-ai==0.1.0
     - aiohttp==3.9.3

### Technical Details
1. Resume Processing Improvements
   - Structured JSON format for consistent parsing
   - Better section organization (Experience, Education, Skills)
   - Improved bullet point handling
   - Added contact information parsing

2. Security Enhancements
   - Moved API keys to .env file
   - Added proper environment variable handling
   - Secured sensitive configuration

### Next Steps
1. Check if the LLM is working correctly
2. Update Flask app to use new resume processor
3. Implement frontend changes for structured display
4. Add error handling for API calls
5. Add caching for parsed resumes

### Notes
- DeepSeek LLM chosen for cost-effectiveness
- Environment variables properly secured
- Project structure reorganized for better maintainability

## February 16, 2025 - LangChain Integration and Cost Optimization Issues

### Major Changes
1. Switched from direct Claude API to LangChain
   - Implemented LangChain for better abstraction
   - Added JSON output parsing
   - Created test file for LangChain verification

2. Fixed Various Technical Issues
   - Resolved async/sync handling in Flask
   - Fixed file path issues for uploads
   - Improved error handling for file processing
   - Updated JSON template escaping in prompts

3. Identified Cost Concerns
   - Discovered high API costs with Claude-3-opus
   - Identified need for optimization
   - Tested basic functionality with simple queries

### Technical Details
1. LangChain Implementation
   - Added langchain and langchain-anthropic packages
   - Created structured JSON parsing system
   - Implemented proper template formatting
   - Added async support with proper error handling

2. File Structure Improvements
   - Fixed upload directory path handling
   - Added better cleanup for temporary files
   - Improved error handling for file operations

### Issues Identified
1. Cost Efficiency
   - High API costs for basic operations
   - Need for optimization in API usage
   - $1 cost for just two test requests

### Next Steps
1. Implement cost optimization strategies:
   - Local PDF processing before LLM
   - Caching system for processed resumes
   - Consider cheaper model alternatives
   - Implement batch processing
   - Optimize prompts for token efficiency
   - Use local processing where possible

### Notes
- LangChain integration successful but needs optimization
- Current implementation works but is cost-prohibitive
- Need to balance functionality with API costs

## February 19, 2025 - Code update 
- Still stuck on resume parsing issue 
- Want to make the uploaded resume interactive 

## February 25, 2025 - Major UI Overhaul and Resume Parser Improvements

### UI Improvements
1. Implemented a two-column layout
   - Left column: Interactive resume editor with form fields
   - Right column: Real-time resume preview in PDF-like format
   - Made layout responsive and use full browser width

2. Resume Preview Enhancements
   - Created professional PDF-like styling for the preview
   - Implemented standard US Letter dimensions (8.5in Ã— 11in)
   - Added proper typography and spacing for resume elements
   - Ensured preview updates in real-time as edits are made

3. Resume Parser Improvements
   - Enhanced PDF parsing to better extract structured data
   - Improved section detection (Education, Experience, Skills)
   - Added support for contact information including LinkedIn and GitHub
   - Better handling of bullet points and formatting

4. Interactive Editing Features
   - Added ability to edit all resume sections
   - Implemented add/delete functionality for sections, entries, and bullet points
